# Currency_classifier
This python-based project is focused on identifying Bangladeshi currency. In total, it can predict eight Bangladeshi Taka notes which are currently available.

For this project, we created a dataset. This dataset has 70 thousands image of 8 types of bangladeshi banknotes. The images are labeled by the name of the note. And all of them are resized to the ratio of 1.25 which the actual ratio of BD banknotes. Both old and new banknotes have been included. The images are in RGB format. the link is given below: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahnumatasnim1604103/bangladeshi-banknote-dataset

This project would not be possible without the help of my team mates. Our complete research is published here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9331182 . So if you find this dataset helpful and end up using it. Be sure to cite our paper. You may gain insights from the paper also. Happy Developing!
